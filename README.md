# Desktop Google Keep OSX
A Super Simple Desktop Client for Mac OSX Built in Javascript and MacGap

# Why
I love the Google suite but hate being limited to having to use their apps within my browser.  If you have many tabs, it's impractical for usability.

# What
It's one line of code to wrap Google Keep in an app window made possible by [MacGap] (https://github.com/MacGapProject/MacGap2)

# Build
Build using instructions on [MacGap-rb] (https://github.com/maccman/macgap-rb)

# Run
Click the pretty icon :)
